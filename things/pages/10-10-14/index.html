		<H1>FSAE Electric Car Dashboard Display and Interface</H1>


		<p class="blocktext">
		I created a dashboard display for the UC Davis 2014 electric formula car to
		provide the driver with critical information, such as battery state of
		charge, and the rest of the team with the state of the system for debugging
		and maintenence of the battery. The unit was completed in 2 to 3 months
		during an active school year. The car competed in the international 2014 <a
		href=http://students.sae.org/cds/formulaseries/electric/"">FSAE Electric in
		Nebraska, Lincoln</a> competition and acheived third place.
		</p>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The dashboard display features a 128x64 LCD Screen (controlled by the
		popular KS108), an LED bar graph, a piezo buzzer, and a rotary encoder with
		an integrated button. Rotating the rotary encoder switched between several
		preconfigured screens of information about the battery's condition. The
		battery information was received via serial communication with another board
		connected to the car's CAN bus.
		</p>

		<p class="blocktext">
		Initially, development began on the Arduino Uno (an <a
		href="http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATMEGA328P.aspx">ATmega328P</a>) and a
		simple breadboard.  Since FSAE is intended as an education opportunity, I
		wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jongtao/KS108_Driver">graphical library
		for the KS108 from scratch</a>, including extras such as text printing and
			rectangle drawing functions, and tried to avoid Arduino environment
			libraries to create portable code. I also wrote program for the PC to
			convert PNG images into C constants that I can simply copy and paste into
			the program source files to complement the graphical library. The
			converter program requires libpng.

	After developing the graphics driver, I realized that the Arduino Uno had
	insufficient memory to hold the pixels states and collect data comfortably.
	The <a href=http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html"">Teensy++ 2.0 by
	PJRC</a>, an <a
	href=http://www.atmel.com/devices/AT90USB1286.aspx"">AT90USB1286</a> chip,
	was chosen as a replacement. The graphics driver was written with AVR macros
	and no arduino libraries, so the program was easily reconfigured for the new
	platform.
	</p>

	<p class="blocktext">
	The initial breadboard was bulky and fragile, so I used free-hanging wire-wrap
	(30 AWG) to make all the connections. Since the wire was solid core and the
	ploject flexed from the lack of structural support, it eventually deteriorated
	from simply moving the project around.

	Originally, a menu system was implemented, which required the integrated push
	button to traverse. Scrapped features of the car, including a very large
	sensor network, led to a great simplification of the virtual user interface.

	<p class="blocktext">
	Light hitting the top of the LED caused the LEDs to "glow" as they diffused
	the light. A peice of masking tape covering the top was surprisingly effective
	in raising the contrast.

	For a very long time, the display was developed without the real information
	to debug from, since the other systems were not completed yet. The first real
	connection and debugging happened in a hotel room at competition. In the
	following pictures, a hidden CAN enabled micro-controller is attached to the
	back of the unit to provide CAN communication with the battery. A test box and
	CAN bus terminating resistor was needed to successfully activate the battery
	pack for testing.

	Due to the lack of time for development for both this project and projects
	this depended on, the display unit's packaging was rushed. For example, the
	CAN micro-controller that provided compatibility was simply zip-tied to the
	back of the display unit, which eventually led to corrosion through moisture
	and death of the part. Another example is the mechanical positioning of the
	unit too high up the dashboard, which rendered the LED bar graph invisible to
	the driver. The PCB design itself could have been slimmed down with permanant
	mounting of the LCD without tall header sockets and use of the microcontroller
	without the dev board.

	The students of Unicamp (Universidade Estadual de Campinas) took first place
	at the end. Their dashboard display was interestingly spartan, with only a
	small dip style LED bar and a seven-segment display. Perhaps there is virtue
	in simplicity.
