		I made this AM radio for a communication electronics class. I originally
		built this on a breadboard, but I decided to make it more permanent. There
		were other projects in the class where having a transmitter was helpful for
		debugging. This radio was built incrementally over a couple of months, so
		the final "design" is a bit of a cobble.

		The radio has a retractable random wire 3 meter antenna. I just have to be
		extra careful when I pull it back out so that it doesn't snag on anything.

		<p class="blocktext">
		This radio works on the principle of controlling how strongly a class C
		amplifier drives a tank circuit. The radio is designed to transmit in the
		commercial AM broadcast band from about 500 kHz to 1700 kHz, so its
		broadcast can be received with any common AM receiver. Regulations from the
		FCC (Part 15) limit the antenna length and power. The radio's broadcast
		range is poor, across a small room at most.

		<H3>Setting the Carrier Frequency</H3>
		<p class="blocktext">
		The carrier frequency is set by the resonant frequency of the tank circuit
		(L3, C12, C14). The frequency generated by the oscillator must match the
		resonant frequency for the strongest transmission. It may be difficult to
		match the frequency with an oscillator if the Q value of the tank is high.
		I chose to use a tunable 555 circuit as an oscillator. A CMOS
		version of the 555 was used to reliably reach frequencies around 1 MHz.
		</p>
		<H3>Amplitude Modulation</H3>
		<p class="blocktext">
		The audio section consists of a 741 op-amp with its output buffered by
		transistor Q1. The audio output signal from this section sets the DC voltage
		of the collector of the driving transistor Q3, which implements the class C
		amplifier.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		Transistor Q3 is driven to saturation by the oscillator through Q2.  The
		tank circuit smooths out this sharp driving action. Since the tank holds
		energy and continues the oscillation back at the collector of Q3, the change
		in voltage at Q3's collector is the difference between the target amplitude
		set by the audio and the amplitude of the tank circuit's oscillation. The
		tank circuit's amplitude diminishes over time, so Q3's operation can be
		thought of as topping off the tank at each cycle until the amplitude of
		oscillation is equal to the audio's amplitude.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		There are caveats of using a tank circuit in this way. Transistor Q3 may not
		drive the tank strongly enough to follow a large amplitude increase in the
		audio signal. A second caveat is that the tank circuit must allow its
		oscillation decay quickly to follow a large amplitude decrease in the audio
		signal. This limitation is apparent in an image, later in this post, of a
		Lissajous pattern where the audio signal is a square wave.
		</p>

		<H2>Notable Features</H2>
		<p class="blocktext">
		The 7805 regulator provides a DC bias to an audio input to power electret
		microphones, which make things more fun.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		The audio section mixes (additive mix) a stereo audio input to a mono
		signal.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		Inductor L4 provides a rough match to the antenna's capacitance at the
		resonant frequency. A 1 mH inductor seems to do the trick for a 3 m random
		wire antenna.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		The 555's frequency is highly susceptible to supply voltage. Also, its
		frequency drifts with temperature as its timing resistors heat up. It's a
		"feature."

		<p class="blocktext">
		The following image from a textbook shows the voltage that would be
		observed at the collector of Q3. The textbook measures the voltage against
		a different reference so the plot is upside down compared to what would be
		seen in my circuit.

		The following image shows the actual voltage at Q3 compared to the
		oscillator's output. It's not as ideal as what the textbook describes, but
		it's close enough.
		</p>

		The next image shows the output to the antenna, right after the tank

		the driving of the tank. The result is a clean sine wave.

		<H3>Lissajous Analysis</H3>

		<p class="blocktext">
		Lissajous patterns are cool.
		</p>

		Lissajous from a textbook [3]
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The X signal is the audio signal, while the Y signal is the modulated
		output. The trapezoidal Lissajous pattern can be used to measure linearity
		and modulation index of the signal. The figure of merit in linearity is how
		straight the sides of the trapezoid are.
		</p>

		<div class="img">
		<a href="img/small_lissajous.JPG">
		<p><img src="thumbs/small_lissajous.JPG" alt="Lissajous with small audio
		signal"/></p>
		</a>
		<p class="blocktext">
		Audio Input: Small amplitude 1 kHz triangle wave
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		X: Audio 2 V/div, Y: Modulated 2 V/div
		</p>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The asymmetry in the trapezoid of the following image reveals leftover
		distortion from the driving of the tank circuit. The linearity between the
		audio input and the resulting envelop is ok.
		</p>


		<div class="img">
		<a href="img/large_lissajous.JPG">
		<p><img src="thumbs/large_lissajous.JPG" alt="Lissajous with large audio
		signal"/></p>
		</a>
		<p class="blocktext">
		Audio Input: Large amplitude 1 kHz triangle wave
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		X: Audio 2 V/div, Y: Modulated 2 V/div
		</p>
		</div>


		<p class="blocktext">
		As the modulation index increases, the trapezoid will become taller. At an
		index of 100% the trapezoid becomes a triangle.
		</p>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The following image shows what happens when I overload the audio amplifier
		with a very large signal, making the op-amp very unhappy. The radio is not
		capable of reaching 100% modulation.
		</p>


		<div class="img">
		<a href="img/overload_lissajous.JPG">
		<p><img src="thumbs/overload_lissajous.JPG" alt="Lissajous with overloaded
		and clipped audio signal"/></p>

		<p class="blocktext">
		Audio Input: Extremely large amplitude 1 kHz triangle wave
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		X: Audio 2 V/div, Y: Modulated 2 V/div
		</p>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		Next, I replace the audio signal with a square wave of reasonable amplitude.
		The Lissajous pattern reveals two trapezoids, which probably correspond to
		the rising and falling edges of the square wave.
		</p>

		<a href="img/square_lissajous.JPG">
