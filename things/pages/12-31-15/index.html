		<H1>YOGO Grenade</H1>

		<p class="blocktext">
			YOGO Grenade is a game written for Ludum Dare 28. The name Yogo Grenade is
			short for "You Only Get One Holy Hand Grenade." The goal of the game is to
			hold off a Fibonacci series of bunnies and to stay alive for as long as
			possible.

		<H2>YOGO Grenade</H2>

		<p class="blocktext">
			I wrote this game for the Ludum Dare 28 Competition (Winter 2013), where
			the given challenge was to write a game within 48 hours while adhering to
			the theme "You Only Get One." Once completed, all contestants would play
			and rate each others' games.
		</p>

		<p class="blocktext">
			The player character is a little girl with a machine gun in a blocky
			world. There is a purple portal where evil man-eating bunnies spawn. Every
			few seconds bunnies spawn in Fibonacci increments to overwhelm the player.
			In times of need the player can throw a single holy hand grenade which
			wipes out all the bunnies. The grenade throw is ultimately futile, since
			the Fibonacci increments become ridiculous over time. The game is heavily
			inspired by Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

		<H2>Controls and Gameplay</H2>

	
		<p class="blocktext">
			The player moves the character with the WAD keys for jump, move left, and
			move right, repectively. The player fires the machine gun with the left
			mouse button and throws the holy hand grenade with the right mouse button.
		</p>

		<p class="blocktext">
			You can also make your own levels! The map.txt file is an "ascii art"
			image of the level. 'M' are the wall tiles and, 'S' is the player spawn,
			and 'E' is Rabbit spawn. This turns the game into a kind of sandbox, since
			the player can build and defend their very own bunny fortresses. The
			original <i>map.txt</i> is shown below. You can see the map in its proper
			orientation by rotating it 90 degrees counter clockwise.

		<H2>The Process of Writing</H2>
		<p class="blocktext">
			I only knew C++ well at the time, so I chose to write the game in C++ with
			the Allegro game library. I chose to write a simple platformer for
			simplicity. Writing any game in C++ within 48 hours from scratch is
			difficult, since you spend a lot of time programming for the computer
			instead of programming for the game. After writing the game on Linux, I
			realized nobody could play the game because a majority of gamers are on
			Windows, so I hastily slapped my code into a Visual Studio project and
			ported the game to Windows (Allegro is cross-platform friendly).
		</p>

		<H2>State of the Project</H2>
		<p class="blocktext">
			I've compiled this on a 64-bit machine with Debian and Windows 7. The game
			may not run straight out of the box anymore. There also seems to be memory
			problems in the Windows version. I recommend compiling from source (it
			just needs liballegro) to ensure compatibility, but you can try the
			executables first.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
			You can find actual game and download links on the
			<a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=31552">
			original Ludum Dare submission page</a>. The source code is on Github
			<a href="https://github.com/jongtao/yogo-grenade">here</a>. The
			repository also has my compiled executables in the build folder.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
			The game is currently a dead project, since I am not likely to touch it again.
