\section{Experience and Projects}
\begin{adjustwidth}{16pt}{0pt}

\noindent\textbf{New Product Introduction Electrical Engineer} - Internship at Keysight Technologies
\hfill 2015
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
	\item Verified power sequencing and reliability in a modular 20GHz
	PXI Vector Signal Generator with SPICE simulations.
	\item Wrote test automation scripts to significantly shorten the time needed
	to generate netlists from schematics, simulate the circuit, and perform
	evaulation of circuit reliability.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Electric Vehicle Management Electronics and Telemetry} - Senior Design Project
\hfill 2014 - 2015
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
	\item High voltage electric vehicle battery management system.
	\item CAN bus sensor network logging and wireless telemetry to a custom
	desktop application.
\end{itemize}



\vspace{8pt}
\noindent\textbf{Formula SAE Student Electric} - Race Car Design Competition
\hfill 2013 - Present
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
	\item The team took 3rd place at the SAE Electric International competition of
	2014 in Lincoln, Nebraska.
	\item Programmed a supervisory control unit for catching and resolving faults
	to prevent harm to hardware and people.
	\item Designed and built both the hardware and software of a driver dashboard
	user interface for monitoring the vehicle's drivetrain and battery in real
	time.
	\item Developed a KS-108 LCD driver with basic font and geometry rendering
	routines. Created a complementary program to convert PNG images into text
	hexadecimal constants to be easily inserted into C program source code of the
	dashboard user interface.
\end{itemize}
