			Now what? You have to get to those config files that belong to root but
			you’re not root and cd doesn’t exist. cd doesn’t exist?! BUT IT DOES
			EXIST! WHAT?!
		</p>


		<H2>The why and the Fix</H2>

		<p class="blocktext">
			Sudo is used for running binaries as root temporarily. You can try
			searching for cd (id est "whereis cd"), but it doesn’t exist! That’s
			because cd is part of the shell and not of another program. In order to
			use cd as root, we must use the shell as a root. The solution is
			to su the way through:
		</p>

<pre class="code">
sudo su
cd /root
</pre>

		<p class="blocktext">
			or (with your favorite shell program)
		</p>

<pre class="code">
sudo bash
cd /root
</pre>
