		Sometimes, you only have the surface mount device (SMD) package of a chip to
		work with in prototyping, but SMD chips do not fit into breadboards.  Common
		ways to solve this problem are getting the dual in-line package (DIP)
		version of the chip or soldering the chip to an SMD adapter board. What if
		you really needed to use the chip NOW? An alternative to the aforementioned
		sensible options is converting your SMD chip manually by soldering them to
		headers. 
		</p>

		<H2>The Not-So-Sensible Solution (For Desperate People)</H2>
		<p class="blocktext">
		Here, I solder an SMD packaged chip (a MCP2551 in this case) to a perforated
		prototyping board with headers. The chip is flipped upside down to prevent
		its pins from touching the plated vias and to bring the chip's pins to an
		easily accessible height for soldering. The flipping technique is sometimes
		called "turtling" by some people in the industry. If you have a non-plated
		perforated prototyping board, you can simply connect the chip's pins to the
		headers with thin traces of solder. It may help to scrape some markings on
		the bottom of the chip to indicate its orientation. The chip is rotated 90
		degrees to fit the chip easily between the headers and to prevent the wires
		from overlapping.

		<p class="blocktext">
		The headers were soldered on first. Then, a single connection was made
		between a header pin and a chip pin, so that the chip was securely attached
		to the board while soldering. Finally, each chip pin was soldered to the
		correct header with 30 AWG wire-wrapping wires. The chip is held down by
		the many wires connecting across it. An extra drop of adhesive would firmly
		secure the chip to the board.

		<p class="blocktext">
		In case of a larger chip, a thin enameled wire may be used, since the lack
		of thick plastic insulation allows more wires to fit across the chip. The
		wires will overlap on a larger chip, and the chip's orientation will be
		parallel to the headers. When I was finished, I clipped a corner off of the
		board to indicate chip orientation (e.g.  indicated the position of the
		first pin). The entire process took me 45 minutes on the first try. I
		estimate that it would take me about 30 minutes to do this, if I knew what I
		was doing.
