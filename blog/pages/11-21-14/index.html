		Sometimes, you only have the surface mount device (SMD) package of a chip to
		work with in prototyping, but SMD chips do not fit into breadboards.  Common
		ways to solve this problem are getting the dual in-line package (DIP)
		version of the chip or soldering the chip to an SMD break-out board. What if
		you really needed to use the chip NOW? An alternative to the sensible
		options aforementioned is converting your SMD chip manually by soldering
		them to headers.

		<H2>The Not-So-Sensible Solution</H2>
		<p class="blocktext">
		Here, I solder an SOIC chip (a MCP2551 in this case) to a perforated
		prototyping board with headers. The chip is flipped upside down to prevent
		its pins from touching the plated vias. Flipping the chip also brings the
		chip's pins to an easily accessible height for soldering. It may help to
		scrape some markings on the bottom of the chip to indicate its orientation.
		The chip is rotated 90 degrees to fit the chip easily between the headers
		and to prevent fly wires from overlapping.

		<p class="blocktext">
		The headers were soldered on first. Then, a single connection was made
		between a header pin and a chip pin, so that the chip was securely attached
		to the board while soldering. The fly wires I used were 30 AWG
		wire-wrappping wires. A thin enameled wire may be used if there are more
		pins to connect, since the lack of thick plastic insulation allows more
		wires to fit across the chip. When I was finished, I clipped a corner off of
		the board to indicate chip orientation (e.g. indicated the position of the
		first pin). The entire process took me 45 minutes on the first try. I
		estimate that it would take me about 30 minutes to do this, if I knew what I
		was doing.
