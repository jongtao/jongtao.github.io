		<H1>Printing a Unix Directory Tree Diagram</H1>


<p class="blocktext">
There exists a program called <i>tree</i> that recursively prints a
graphical tree diagram to the terminal. In the spirit of the Unix
philosophy, however, there is another way to print a tree with the basic
Unix programs [1].
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre class="code">find | sed 's;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|;  |;g'</pre>
</div>



<p class="blocktext">
Let us do a short walkthrough of what this command does.
</p>



<H2>A Walkthrough on Tree Printing</H2>



<p class="blocktext">
Using <i>find</i> alone yields the full path of every file on each line.
Interestingly, it is difficult to recursively print all full paths on single
lines with <i>ls</i>, which is why <i>find</i> is used instead. The output
format of <i>find</i> is convenient to parse with <i>sed</i>.
</p>



<div class="code">
<pre class="code">$ find
.

</pre>
</div>



<p class="blocktext">
Here, we pipe the full paths of all directories under our present working
directory into sed, which replaces everything between the first forward slash
and the last forward slash with lines depicting the tree.
</p>

<H2>Adding a Bit of Polish</H2>


<p class="blocktext">
Of course, the we can elaborate on this simple command, as demonstrated by the
following polished command. In this command, I omit hidden files from the tree
by removing lines with hidden files from the output of <i>find</i>. I then sort
the lines alphanumerically with <i>sort</i>. The final result is piped into
<i>sed</i> to draw the tree.
</p>



<div class="code">
<pre class="code">find | sed '/\/\./d' | sort -d | sed 's;[^/]*/;|___;g;s;___|;  |;g'</pre>
</div>



<p class="blocktext">
As with all things Unix, a shell script is usually helpful.
</p>



<div class="code">
<pre class="code">#!/bin/bash

# Prints Directory Tree



if [ "$1" == "-h" ]; then # show hidden files
  find | sort -d | sed 's;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|;  |;g'

elif [ "$1" == "-m" ]; then # expect manual input pipe
  sed 's;[^/]*/;|____;g;s;____|;  |;g'

else
  find | sed '/\/\./d' | sort -d | sed 's;[^/]*/;|___;g;s;___|;  |;g'

fi</pre>
</div>



<H2>A Comparison with the tree Program</H2>


<p class="blocktext">
tree is a properly written program that has all the options you could wish for.
It is better that our little command in almost every way, especially in speed.
<i>lt</i> is the shell script from before.
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre class="code">$ time lt > /dev/null; time tree > /dev/null

real	0m0.613s
user	0m0.628s
sys	0m0.104s

real	0m0.078s
user	0m0.056s
sys	0m0.020s</pre>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The output is almost exactly the same, except for the pretty box characters and
the omission of the extra pipe characters indicating directory depth.
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre class="code">$ lt; tree

<H2>Beyond Directory Trees</H2>

<p class="blocktext">
One drawback of the <i>tree</i> command is that it is purpose built and can not
do anything else besides drawing directory trees (although it does just that
very well). With our simple command we can pipe in more than just a directory
list. We can use this to visualize things like dependencies in a C programming
project or a simple family tree. A bit of <i>awk</i> should get whatever you
need into the single line format that works so well with <i>sed</i>.
