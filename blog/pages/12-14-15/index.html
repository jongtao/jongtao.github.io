			I wrote "Minceraft," a rather simplified version of Minecraft, for an
			embedded system. The board used was a Wyzbee development board from
			Redpine, which had an ARM-based Spansion microcontroller on it. The board
			receives input from a standard infrared TV remote, as breifly seen in the
			video.

			In the game, the player spawns as a two pixel figure in a randomly
			generated world. The world is generated by using the time spent on the
			welcome screen as the seed. The player can jump and move left or right
			with predictable physics, which include realistic trajectories and
			friction. The player can also "dig", which removes adjacent blocks from
			the world. The player can dig toward any of the eight cardinal directions.

			This game was part of a class project where the student was supposed to
			"do something interactive" with the LED screen and the IR remote. The
			broken lines on the LED screen were caused by a faulty connection on the
			flexible connector to the screen. Class materials experience the worse of
			wear and tear.
