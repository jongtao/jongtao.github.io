		<H1>The Sakai Top</H1>


		<p class="blocktext">
		I've come across the rather fascinating Sakai Top, a top made from a single
		wire. The top was described in 1986 by Takao Sakai, a professor of
		mechanical engineering at the Fukushima Technology Centre of Kohriyama-City
		[1]. The top is also known as the paperclip top, since it is often made with
		paperclips.  The physics behind the top is often "left up to the reader as
		an exercise."

		<H2>The Physics Exercise of the Top</H2>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The Sakai Top is constructed such that the the spokes are balanced by the
		missing arc in the top [2]. In other words, the total gravitational torque
		on the spokes is equal to the gravitational torque on the material that
		would have filled the missing arc. Let the subscript 1 denote descriptions
		for the missing arc, and subscript 2 denote descriptions for the spokes.
		</p>

		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/1.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/1.png" alt="eq1"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		Here, we see we need four quantities. <i>y1</i> is the center of mass of the
		"missing" arc, and <i>y2</i> is the center of mass of the spokes. <i>y1</i>
		and <i>y2</i> are distances away from the center of the top. Note that we
		assume that the top is symmetric about the bisector of the angle formed by
		the spokes, so both centers of mass lie on this bisector. <i>m1</i> is the
		mass of the arc, while <i>m2</i> is the total mass of the spokes. Both
		masses are modeled as point masses. Finally, <i>g</i> is the gravitational
		acceleration.
		</p>

		</a>
		</div>


		<H3>Description of the Missing Arc</H3>

		<p class="blocktext">
		Let's look at arc's center of mass, <i>y1</i>. The center of mass is the
		weighted average of positions along the angle bisector using the masses at
		each position as the weights. 
		</p>
		
		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/2.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/2.png" alt="eq2"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		First, <i>dm</i> is a small change in mass, which proportional to a very
		small arc <i>s</i> it belongs to. <i>λ</i> is the mass per length of the
		wire. Arc length <i>s</i> is described by the top's radius <i>r</i> and a
		very small angle <i>θ</i>.
		</p>

		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/3.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/3.png" alt="eq3"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>


		<p class="blocktext">
		Second, the position along the bisector <i>y</i> can be described in terms
		of an angle <i>θ</i> and radius <i>r</i> with trigonometry.
		</p>

		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/4.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/4.png" alt="eq4"/></p>

		</div>

		<div class="img">
		<a href="figures/bisector_tex.png">
		<p><img src="figures/bisector_tex.png" alt="bisector_tex"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>



		<p class="blocktext">
		With these two descriptions, we can solve for the center of mass of the arc.
		Recognizing the symmetry along the bisector, we can integrate from 0 to
		<i>ϕ</i>, which we'll define as half of the angle formed by the spokes. The
		angle is referenced from the bisector.
		</p>


		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/5.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/5.png" alt="eq5"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		We can describe the mass of the arc <i>m1</i> with its mass density
		and length, as done previously. Note that <i>ϕ</i> is half of the angle of
		the arc, so we need <i>2ϕ</i> to describe the full arc.
		</p>


		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/6.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/6.png" alt="eq6"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>


		<p class="blocktext">
		With <i>y1</i> and <i>m1</i>, we can describe the torque due to the
		"missing" arc.
		</p>


		<H3>Description of the Two Spokes</H3>

		<p class="blocktext">
		Let's look at spokes' center of mass, <i>y2</i>. We take a shortcut
		around integrating for <i>y2</i> by seeing that half of the mass lies below
		half of the radius, while the other half of the mass lies above half of the
		radius. The center of mass lies on this midpoint projected onto the
		bisector of the spokes' angle.
		</p>


		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/7.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/7.png" alt="eq7"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The mass of the spokes, <i>m2</i>, is the product of the mass density and
		the total length of the two spokes.
		</p>


		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/8.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/8.png" alt="eq8"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>


		<H3>Equating the Torques</H3>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The problem is now fully constrained, and we can find a specific dimension
		that makes balance possible.
		</p>


		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/9.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/9.png" alt="eq9"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		<i>ϕ</i> is half of the angle between the spokes, and it must be 26.57° for
		the top to balance. The full arc angle is twice of <i>ϕ</i>, which is
		53.13°.
		</p>



		<H2>An Engineering Description</H2>

		<p class="blocktext">
		In terms of practicality, the angle <i>ϕ</i> is not very useful when it
		comes to actually making a top. Who actually has a protractor on hand?
		Since you start building the top with a certain length of material and
		probably have a ruler somewhere, it makes sense to describe the balance
		condition as a length instead of an angle.
		</p>

		<p class="blocktext">
		From a length of material, we'll form the top's tip, handle, and the spokes
		with the not-missing arc. Let's describe the length taken up by the spokes
		and the existing arc with <i>L</i>.  The tip and the handle are not
		constrained by the balance condition, so we don't need to focus too much
		those lengths.
		</p>

		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/10.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/10.png" alt="eq10"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>


		<p class="blocktext">
		The length <i>L</i>, which affects the balance of the top, consists of the
		two spokes and the existing arc.
		</p>


		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/11.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/11.png" alt="eq11"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The existing arc exists over the external angle, <i>θ_external</i>, formed
		by the two spokes. We can describe the external angle in terms of the
		internal angle <i>2ϕ</i> that we previously found.
		</p>


		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/12.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/12.png" alt="eq12"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		Now, we find the balance condition in terms of the length <i>L</i> of
		material we are using.
		</p>

		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/13.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/13.png" alt="eq13"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>


		<p class="blocktext">
		Using this radius-to-length ratio, we can replace a protractor with a ruler
		and a calculator (or multiplication skills) to find the radius from a given
		length of material. If you are particularly keen on geometry, you may skip
		multiplication altogether and use the approximated 1/7 with methods of
		dividing a line segment into n equal parts (this does require a compass,
		though). The ratio 1/7 deviates only 5.12% from the actual value.
		</p>

		<H3>Measurements for Verification</H3>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The process of manually bending a wire into a top is difficult to do right.
		Fortunately, just a couple of measurements can show if the top is correct.
		</p>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The first measurement is to make sure the top is round with the correct
		radius. Measure the radii around the whole top to make sure it's right.
		</p>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The second measurement is done to verify the angle. Since the angle is
		difficult to measure without a protractor, we can use the length of the
		chord produced by the two spokes to verify the angle. We can also represent
		the chord length in terms of the radius, which is proportional to the
		original length <i>L</i>.
		</p>

		<div class="equation_img">
		<a href="latex/14.png">
		<p><img class="equation" src="latex/14.png" alt="eq14"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The approximated chord-to-length ratio 1/8 is off by only 2.80%.
		</p>

		<H2>An Example Build</H2>

		<p class="blocktext">
		Here lies a common paperclip. I'll be using a pair of pliers and a caliper.
		</p>

		<div class="img">
		<a href="img/DSC_0221.JPG">
		<p><img src="thumb/DSC_0221.JPG" alt="a paperclip"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		I begin by uncurling the paperclip. It seems that the paperclip gives about
		10 cm of material.
		</p>

		<div class="img">
		<a href="img/DSC_0222.JPG">
		<p><img src="thumb/DSC_0222.JPG" alt="an uncurled paperclip"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>


		<p class="blocktext">
		I make the tip and handle of the top. In general, keeping the handle and tip
		short will give you more material to form the body of the top, which will
		increase its rotational moment of inertia and make the top spin for a longer
		time. After bending the handle and tip, a length <i>L = 85.65 mm </i> is
		left. 
		</p>

		<div class="img">
		<a href="img/DSC_0223.JPG">
		<p><img src="thumb/DSC_0223.JPG" alt="the tip and handle"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>



		<p class="blocktext">
		Using our derived ratio, I find the radius <i>r = 11.64 mm</i>. I make the
		bends for the spokes to be the length of the radius.
		</p>

		<div class="img">
		<a href="img/DSC_0225.JPG">
		<p><img src="thumb/DSC_0225.JPG" alt="radius"/></p>

		<div class="img">
		<a href="img/DSC_0226.JPG">
		<p><img src="thumb/DSC_0226.JPG" alt="radii"/></p>
		</a>
		</div>

		<p class="blocktext">
		After making the spokes, all that's left is the main arc. I make many very
		small bends along the wire with my pliers (patience is the key). The chord
		of the completed top according to the previous calculations should be 10.41
		mm.

		<div class="img">

		<p class="blocktext">
		The result is a very well balanced top.
