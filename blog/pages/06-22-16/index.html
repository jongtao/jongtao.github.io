		<p class="blocktext">
		I built a cheap software defined synthesizer with an Atmel AVR
		microcontroller and a discrete transistor VCO. In simple words, it's just a
		frequency generator.
		</p>

		<p class="blocktext">
		The microcontroller measures the frequency from a VCO and adjusts its DAC
		output voltage to the VCO, so that the VCO's output frequency matches a
		user-defined target.  This closed loop feedback system is essentially a
		software defined PLL (Phased Locked Loop). The software is equivalent to a
		hardware PLL with a ridiculously large divider value and an extremely flabby
		loop filter. Since the feedback loop is very slow compared to a hardware
		PLL, the system is used to correct slow oscillator drift rather than
		synchronize the output phase to a reference, as hardware
		PLLs usually do.

		<H2>The System Brief</H2>

		<ul>
			<li>
			Frequency synthesis from 100 kHz to 1800 kHz in arbitrary intervals. The
			output frequency is accurate to 200 ppm.
			</li>
			<li>
			A quad seven-segment display shows the target frequency with a
			precision of 1 kHz.
			</li>
			<li>
			There are two buttons to increase or decrease the frequency in 1 kHz
			intervals. I also got carried away and added a feature where it steps in
			10 kHz intervals if you hold down the button. The 1 kHz control interval
			was chosen to match the display's precision.
			</li>
			<li>
			It is a low voltage system where both the microcontroller and VCO run on
			3.3 V.
			</li>
			<li>
			Low cost! Transistors are cheap.
			</li>
			<li>
			It sometimes breaks when I touch it. I should not have built it on a
			breadboard. I should not have built it on a breadboard. I should not have
			built it on a breadboard.

		<H3>The VCO</H3>
		<p class="blocktext">
		The VCO is based on a current controlled relaxation oscillation (emitter
		coupled). The voltage control is not linear with frequency, so feedback is
		necessary to get accurate frequency control. It is difficult to buffer and
		amplify the output frequency from the VCO because any current drawn from
		this circuit will affect the frequency or even duty cycle.

		<H3>PWM DAC Voltage Control and Filter</H3>
		<p class="blocktext">
		The VCO's voltage control input is driven by the microcontroller through a
		PWM DAC. The PWM ripple contributes to phase noise, so it is important to
		filter it out. However, it is also important to allow the PWM output to
		fluctuate at lower frequencies to make voltage corrections quickly.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		My PWM filter is a simple double RC filter (two RC lowpass filters in series).
		According to SPICE, the filter crushes the 1 kHz ripple with about -100 dB
		of attenuation, but at the same time preserves frequency response up to 10
		Hz (although with a little attenuation).
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		A subtlety of using an RC filter with the VCO is that the current gain,
		Beta, of the VCO's input transistor is not that great (it's a 2N2222). The
		base current of that transistor will cause a voltage drop across the RC
		filter. The voltage drop limits the controlled frequency range on the VCO,
		so a high beta transistor, Darlington pair, or an op-amp should be used.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		I chose to use a PWM DAC over a GPIO R2R ladder DAC because the synthesizer
		is a feedback control system that requires components with monotonic
		outputs. In other words, a monotonic DAC is required to make small
		adjustments in the right direction. R2R ladders are difficult to implement
		reliably due to inconsistencies in GPIO drive levels and resistor accuracy.
		Often, the inconsistencies will not only reduce accuracy but also create
		instances where the output changes non-monotonically.
		</p>

		<H3>Signal Limiter</H3>
		<p class="blocktext">
		Following the VCO are additional gain stages and buffers. The gain stages
		act as a limiter to saturate the VCO's output signal against the supply
		rails. The GPIO pins on the microcontroller are essentially Schmitt
		triggers, so the feedback frequency signal needs to look somewhat like a
		rail-to-rail digital signal.
		</p>



		<H2>Microcontroller Software</H2>
		<p class="blocktext">
		The microcontroller measures the output frequency, applies a PID loop filter
		to the frequency error, and then adjusts the output of its PWM DAC so that
		the output frequency matches the target frequency.
		</p>

		<H3>Frequency Measurement</H3>
		<p class="blocktext">
		The microcontroller measures the feedback frequency by using a gated
		counting method. The input frequency drives an internal counter for a set
		period of time. The final counted value is divided by the time to obtain the
		frequency.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		I used two internal counters, an interrupt driven algorithm, and a crystal
		system clock source to obtain a more precise measurement. One counter was
		driven directly by the feedback frequency from the limiter to count the
		edges of the signal, while a second counter was used to precisely gate the
		frequency counting at regular intervals.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		A limitation of frequency counting is that the microcontroller's inputs are
		synchronized. That means that the microcontroller samples its inputs at its
		system's clock frequency. As a result, the microcontroller can only measure
		frequencies as the Nyquist rate allows. The frequency to be measured must be
		less than half of the system clock. The duty cycle of the measured signal
		should be 50% for optimal measurement, so that the sampling can capture the
		transitions easily.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		In this circuit, I run the system at 8 MHz, so the highest frequency I would
		dare to measure is 3 MHz, which is a little lower than the theoretical 4
		MHz.
		</p>

		<H3>PID Loop Filter</H3>
		<p class="blocktext">
		I used a PID loop filter to process the difference between the target
		frequency and the measured frequency. I also used a different filter for
		when the error is large and small. When the error is very large, I use a
		proportional and a derivative term to get to the target quickly with little
		overshoot. When the error is relatively small, I increase all the constants
		and include an integral term to eliminate steady state error. The steady
		state error comes from drift of the VCO.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		The PID filter was manually tuned. Guessing and checking is hard.
		</p>

		<H3>PWM DAC Software</H3>
		<p class="blocktext">
		I used 13 bits for the PWM counter, which gives me a DAC with 13 bits of
		resolution.  This provides an output voltage range between 3.3 V and 0 V at
		intervals of 400 uV. The small 400 uV from a PWM DAC sounds ridiculous, but
		I was looking for fine control over accuracy. The feedback loop corrects
		accuracy problems.  Also, quantization noise from a low DAC resolution
		contributes to phase noise as the control system chatters across the large
		voltage intervals.
		</p>
		<p class="blocktext">
		Higher resolution gives fine control. However, it decreases the PWM
		frequency, which forces you to decrease your PWM filter's cutoff, which
		decreases the frequency response of voltage corrections made by the
		software. If the PWM filter's cutoff isn't decreased accordingly with the
		PWM frequency, the DAC output will have a lot of ripple which will turn into
		phase noise at the VCO.
		</p>
