		<H1>Resizing a Bootable Linux Partition Containing Grub</H1>

		<p class="blocktext">
			If you dual-boot Linux like I do, then the chances are that you might want
			to either expand or contract your Linux partition. I had some problems
			when I had my first go at it, so here’s how I expanded my partition with
			some notes on the problems. The set of procedures expands a partion
			while preserving its data.
		</p>


		<H2>Programs Used</H2>
		<ol>
		<li>Linux</li>
		<li>gparted</li>
		<li>fdisk</li>
		<li>grub-install</li>
		</ol>

		<H2>The Procedure</H2>

		<p class="blocktext">
		I expanded a Linux partion by taking space from a Windows partition.
		<BR><BR>
		A = Linux partition I wanted to expand
		<BR><BR>
		B = Partition I can take space from
		<BR><BR>
		X = Device identifier
		<BR><BR>
		Y = Partition number
		<BR><BR>
		</p>

	<ol>
	<li>
		I booted into a Linux with gparted through another medium, since I could not
		use the partition (A) I wanted to resize. Partition A must be unmounted.
	</li>
	<li>
		Through gparted, I unmounted the target partition and disabled the swap.
	</li>
	<li>
		I shrunk an partition B with MiB alignment. I then had a chunk of
		unallocated memory ready to be moved or used.
	</li>
	<li>
		I expanded A by adding the unallocated memory to it and hit apply. <b>I hit
		the first roadblock here;</b> If gparted throws an error about libparted
		stopping because of overlapping partitions, redo this step with the
		<b>alignment set to cylinder</b> [1].
	</li>
	<li>
		At this point, the partitions have been resized, but the data for booting
		are in different locations on the physical disk. GRUB could not find that
		data, and I could not boot into the Linux on partition A, which is normal. I
		open a terminal session to reinstall GRUB.
	</li>
	<li>
		I commanded <i>“sudo fdisk -l”</i> to list and confirm the existing
		partitions [2].	
	</li>
	<li>
		I commanded <i>“sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt”</i> to mount partition A to /mnt.
		I got the name /dev/sdXY, the name of Partition A, from the previous step of
		listing partitions [2].	
	</li>
	<li>
		I commanded <i>“sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdX”</i>
		to reinstall grub onto /dev/sdX. The boot directory specifies where GRUB is
		to be installed on the mounted target partition. <b>Do not use /dev/sdXY in
		place of /dev/sdX.</b> /dev/sdX is the name of the device you are targeting
		[2].
	</li>
	<li>
		I ran disk check on my Windows partition to make sure things were ok.
	</li>
	</ol>
