<h1>The Legend of the O(N) Function Call</h1>

<p class="blocktext">
I've come across a rather interesting piece of production code written in
Python. Imagine a world where programmers choose not to define their own
functions at all. Unfortunately, that world is real.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
Writing a giant block of monolithic code without defining functions is not
without challenge. If programmers can't define their own functions, how do they
organize or separate their code? How would they selectively run different blocks
of code?  How would they manage inputs, local variables, and results for their
blocks of code? 
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
Below is a cleaned-up version of a real-world example.
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre class="code">tasks = [1, 2, 3]

database = Database()

Global variables to be used across tasks defined here...

final_results = []


########## Task 1 ##########
if 1 in tasks:
  inputs = database.get(task 1 input data parameters...)
  code for task 1 to create a result...
  result_1 = result
########## End Task 1 ##########


########## Task 2 ##########
if 2 in tasks:
  inputs = database.get(task 2 input data parameters...)
  code for task 2 to create a result...
  result_2 = result
########## End Task 2 ##########


########## Task 3 ##########
if 3 in tasks:
  inputs = database.get(task 3 input data parameters...)
  code for task 3 to create a result...
  result_3 = result
########## End Task 3 ##########


if result_1:
  final_results.append(result_1)

if result_2:
  final_results.append(result_2)

if result_3:
  final_results.append(result_3)</pre>
</div>


<h2>Code Organization and Separation</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
The code that would typically be encapsulated in functions is instead placed
between comments to visually separate them from other tasks. Even when
developing detrimentally monolithic code, programmers still seem to be able to
care about readability for code maintenance.
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre class="code"><b>########## Task 1 ##########</b>
if 1 in tasks:
  inputs = database.get(task 1 input data parameters...)
  code for task 1 to create a result...
  result_1 = result
<b>########## End Task 1 ##########</b></pre>
</div>


<h2>Selective Execution of Code</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
Instead of a typical function call, execution of the code blocks is determined
by looking up the <i>tasks</i> list to see if the code block should be executed.
Since the tasks to be executed are stored in a list, determining whether or not
to execute a task takes O(N) time, where N is the number of tasks to run.
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre class="code">
<b>tasks = [1, 2, 3]</b>

...

########## Task 1 ##########
<b>if 1 in tasks:</b>
  inputs = database.get(task 1 input data parameters...)
  code for task 1 to create a result...
  result_1 = result
########## End Task 1 ##########</pre>
</div>

<h2>Handling Code Inputs</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
The inputs for the tasks come from either global variables or database queries.
While the database queries are alright, the global variables introduce some
dependencies among the tasks. Some tasks expect another task to modify the
global variables, and other tasks don't expect such surprises. Even though the
tasks can be selectively executed, they need to be executed in a certain order,
which is not easily apparent to someone new to the code.
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre class="code"><b>database = Database()</b>

<b>Global variables to be used across tasks defined here...</b>

...

########## Task 1 ##########
if 1 in tasks:
  <b>inputs = database.get(task 1 input data parameters...)</b>
  code for task 1 to create a result...
  result_1 = result
########## End Task 1 ##########</pre>
</div>


<h2>Local Variable Scoping?</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
An interesting detrimental aspect of using <i>if</i> statements instead of
functions in Python is that Python does not define a new scope within <i>if</i>
statements as languages like C or Java do. As a result, this <i>if</i> statement
strategy eliminates the possibility of local variables within tasks. All
variables within this monolithic code block are globally shared across tasks.
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre class="code">########## Task 1 ##########
if 1 in tasks:
  <b>inputs = database.get(task 1 input data parameters...)
  code for task 1 to create a result...
  result_1 = result</b>
########## End Task 1 ##########


########## Task 2 ##########
if 2 in tasks:
  <b>inputs = database.get(task 2 input data parameters...)
  code for task 2 to create a result...
  result_2 = result</b>
########## End Task 2 ##########


########## Task 3 ##########
if 3 in tasks:
  <b>inputs = database.get(task 3 input data parameters...)
  code for task 3 to create a result...
  result_3 = result</b>
########## End Task 3 ##########</pre>
</div>


<h2>Handling Code Results</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
Typical function calls have a return value that exists in the outer scope.  Our
clever programmers knew this too, so they took advantage of the lack of scoping
within the task code blocks mentioned earlier. They declare a new variable for
each task's return results within the task itself.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
Of course, one variable for each result requires too much typing if the results are
to be used by other code. To overcome this predicament, they put all the results
into a list at the very end. Code elsewhere would operate on this list.
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre class="code"><b>final_results = []</b>

...

########## Task 1 ##########
if 1 in tasks:
  inputs = database.get(task 1 input data parameters...)
  code for task 1 to create a result...
  <b>result_1 = result</b>
########## End Task 1 ##########

...

<b>if result_1:
  final_results.append(result_1)

if result_2:
  final_results.append(result_2)

if result_3:
  final_results.append(result_3)</b></pre>
</div>

<h2>As a Whole</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
As a result of not using functions, the programmers created a monolithic block
of code about 500 lines long. Fortunately, these 500 lines were encapsulated in
a function so other people won't have to worry about the code.  Unfortunately,
the programmers decided to repeat this code pattern across thousands of lines in
the code base.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
Finally, no code is complete without test coverage, in an enterprise setting.
The test for this code involves executing the code monolith and printing out the
results. It's fair to say this code base has 100% test coverage, since the test
executes 100% of the code.
