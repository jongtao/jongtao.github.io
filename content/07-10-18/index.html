<h1>Evaluating Thermal Performance of Electrical Connectors</h1>

<p class="blocktext">
The thermal performance of an electrical connector can be evaluated by measuring
the ambient temperature, the temperature at the contact or junction, and the
current flowing though the connector under steady-state conditions. This
relationship allows direct performance comparisons between connectors and
quantification of performance degradation over time. The relationship's simple
computation requirements makes it suitable for embedded systems. Evaluation of
thermal performance is particularly applicable in power delivery applications
where the connector is thermally limited, such as in electric vehicle charging.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
Power connectors degrade over time and eventually require replacement. As a
connector degrades, its contact resistance rises and causes more heat to be
produced as current flows through it. Eventually, the temperature of the
connector may become so high that no additional current can flow through it
without exceeding the connector's rated temperature. In the case where maximum
power delivery is demanded, the maximum possible current is set by the maximum
rated temperature and by the thermal performance of the connector. In light of
this, we are interested in a method to evaluate a connector's electro-thermal
performance to improve power delivery.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
Connector degradation in the form of rising contact resistance is caused by a
combination of chemical corrosion, mechanical deformation, or physical debris.
The ambient environment, mating action (fretting), application of high power,
and sloppy manufacturing create these causes. Connector ailments accumulate and
exacerbate each other to the point where the connector's performance is no
longer considered within specification, prompting replacement.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
In implementations where a connector is thermally-limited, a thermal sensor
monitors the connector and informs a power controller of how much current to
deliver to maintain a safe connector temperature. With an additional ambient
temperature sensor, the connector's thermal performance be readily evaluated.
</p>

<h2>Thermal and Electrical Model</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
For these models, we assume that we can easily measure temperatures and currents
but not thermal or electrical resistance. Realizations of embedded systems
governing high power connectors have sensors to the parameters that are
measurable in the assumption.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The connector's electrical side is modeled as a current source providing
current through its contact as a resistance.

</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The connector's thermal side is modeled as a power source providing heat through
the connector's thermal resistance to the ambient environment, a temperature
source. The power source delivers the same power dissipated by the electrical
resistance in the previously described model.

<p><img class="equation" src="latex/thermal.png" alt="thermal"/></p>
</div>
<p class="blocktext">
Combining these two models, we can isolate the contact resistance from known
variables.
</p>
<div class="img">
<p><img class="equation" src="latex/combine.png" alt="combine"/></p>
</div>
<p class="blocktext">
As we observe, the contact resistance cannot be totally isolated, because we do
not know the thermal resistance. The contact resistance can be isolated, if the
thermal resistance is also measured. However, the comparison of connectors does
not require complete knowledge of the contact resistance. Instead, we can use a
combination of thermal and electrical resistance together as a "heating factor"
<i>H</i> for comparisons. The heating factor has units ΩK/W, or equivalently
Ω°C/W.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
A caveat of this model is that it does not take into account thermal or
electrical capacitances. In typical systems, the junction temperature would lag
behind the application of current, preventing the use of this model during
transient events. In practical application, a time average or aggressive low
pass filtering of the temperatures and currents is used to approximate steady
state conditions.
</p>

<h2>Application of the Heating Factor</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
The heating factor allows us to compare the thermal performance of
connectors to each other. Connectors with a higher heating factor are less
capable at delivering current, and thus power, than connectors with a lower
heating factor.
</p>

<p><img src="matlab/currentheating.png" alt="Current vs. Heating Factor"/></p>
</a>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
Intuitively, a higher heating factor means that a connector less capable at
delivering current due to either high thermal or electrical resistance.
</p>

<p><img class="equation" src="latex/maxcurrent.png" alt="max current"/></p>
</div>

<h3>Comparison of Heating Factors for Different Connectors</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
Connectors with a lower heating factor are more capable at delivering current
than connectors with lower heating factors. In this way, connector performance
may be quantified against a known reference connector for relative performance.
</p>
<div class="img">
<p><img class="equation" src="latex/heatingratio.png" alt="heating ratio"/></p>
</div>

<h3>Comparison of Heating Factors for Similar Connectors</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
Similar connectors are connectors that have the same thermal resistance
<i>R</i>. For evaluating a connector's degradation over time or under difference
conditions, we can assume similar thermal resistances, too. A degraded
connector's heating factor can be compared to the heating factor of a pristine
connector to obtain its contact resistance.
</p>
<div class="img">
<p><img class="equation" src="latex/resistanceratio.png" alt="resistance ratio"/></p>
</div>
<h3>Relating Heating Factor to Connector Specifications</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
A connector's performance may be specified with a minimum deliverable current at
a certain ambient temperature and a maximum temperature for the handle assembly
at the contacts or junction (typically determined by assembly material or human
handling limits). This style of specification allows us to calculate a heating
factor that can be used to create derating curves for that connector.  In this
use case, the following equation defines the minimum current that a given
connector with a maximum heating factor <i>H</i> is capable of.
</p>

<div class="img">
<p><img class="equation" src="latex/derating.png" alt="derating"/></p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The following derating curves are for three hypothetical connectors with a
maximum junction temperature of 75 °C. The three curves are for the connectors
which were capable of delivering different currents while being thermally
limited to 75 °C with the ambient temperature at 27 °C. The three curves
are defined by three different heating factors.
</p>

</a>
</div>

<h3>Evaluating Connectors on an Embedded System</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
Connectors can be evaluated using the heating factor relationship. However,
using the previously described derating curves within an embedded system is not
computationally efficient because the defining relationship includes a
difficult-to-compute square root. Thankfully, evaluation with current is not
necessary, even though the derating curves derate in terms of current, . When
the heating factor is computed from a connector's maximum ratings, that heating
factor should be the maximum value of what can be measured from a connector
within specification. A connector can be considered to be out of specification,
if its heating factor exceeds the maximum rated heating factor.
</p>

<div class="img">
<p><img class="equation" src="latex/comparison.png" alt="comparison"/></p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The following is example code in C to compute the heating factor. Note that the
computation can be easily ported to use a fixed point math library.
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre class="code">#define MIN_ISQUARED 1

bool heatingfactor(double junctionTemp, double ambientTemp, double current,
                   double* result) {
    double iSquared = current * current;
    if(iSquared &lt;= MIN_ISQUARED)
        return false;

    *result = (junctionTemp - ambientTemp) / iSquared;
    return true; 
}</pre>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
Specification testing with the heating factor is easy to implement on an
embedded system attached to a connector, since the computation involves only
simple arithmetic. The big edge case to handle is where the connector current
tends to zero and creates an infinite heating factor. After the system computes
a heating factor, that factor can then be compared with the rated maximum
heating factor to trigger action.
