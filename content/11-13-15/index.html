<h2>The Frontend</h2>

<p class="blocktext">
The Proximity Box senses a user's proximity by detecting the intensity of
infrared light reflected off the user. The modular boxes vary the color of the
several hundred LEDs on their surfaces to indicate the proximity of a detected
object. If you want to know about the innards, skim past the following picture
gallery.

<h2>Overview of Technology</h2>

<p class="blocktext">
The Proximity Box uses infrared sensors for input and addressable LEDs for
output.

<h3>Sensing</h3>

<p class="blocktext">
The basic principle of the Proximity Box is to shine infrared light from the
interactive surface to a nearby object and then detect the intensity of
reflections from objects. Less intensity would mean that the object is further
away, since intensity diminishes with distance.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
One of the challenges of using infrared light is that ambient infrared
interferes with the sensing. I found a solution by using the Vishay TSSP4938
sensors, which have an optical filter to select only a particular wavelength of
infrared and have an integrated demodulator to pick out modulated infrared from
the environment. Modulation can be done by simply blinking an IR LED (or IR LED
strips in my case) at the correct modulation frequency as specified in the
sensor's datasheet.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
Vishay's TSSP line is quite special because they can express intensity as a
pulse width. The more popular version of the sensor only detects whether or not
the light has exceeded a threshold and outputs a binary high or low.  With the
TSSP sensor, a weakly detected signal would correspond to a narrow (in time)
pulse, while a strong one would correspond to a wide pulse. An incredibly strong
signal would give a constant level, an "infinite width pulse." Note that the
pulse encoding is not a continuous PWM signal, but a single impulse-like pulse
beginning when any low intensity IR is detected.  In math-land, the pulse is
<i>u(t) - u(t-a)</i>, where <i>a</i> is proportional to intensity. More about
Vishay's TSSP can be found in their
<a href="materials/tsspagcpsensor.pdf">application note/brochure.</a>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p class="blocktext">
After the sensors detect proximity, corresponding colors were displayed on a
very long chain of APA102 RGB LEDs
(see <a href="../../../blog/pages/02-27-15/">my post on the LED</a>). The
APA102 RGB LEDs are daisy-chained LEDs with memory and a simple
shift-register-like SPI interface.  Although it may seem that there are four
separate surfaces for the Proximity Box, the LEDs are are actually daisy chained
across all four boxes.
</p>

<h2>The Backend Hardware</h2>

<p class="blocktext">
The hardware, modular in design, is composed of the Motherboard, the Panel, and
the Subpanel. A single Motherboard connects to four Panels. Each Panel connects
to four Subpanels. In total there are 128 infrared sensors and 384 output LEDs.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
Since I was a busy student at the time, the hardware was designed with lack of
time on mind. For example, through-hole components were chosen over SMD, since
it's easier to solder or probe through-hole components than SMD.  Another
instance is that I used a resistor network in a DIP form instead of individual
ones to save time while soldering.
</p>

<h3>The Motherboard</h3>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/mobo_pcb_render.png">
<p><img src="thumb/mobo_pcb_render.png" alt="The motherboard"/></p>
</a>
Figure 9. The motherboard
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The motherboard houses the microcontroller, supporting circuity, and connectors.
The microcontroller used was the MSP430 (MSP-EX430F5529LP), chosen for its
availability at the time. Supporting circuity includes a 555 timer for
modulating the infrared LEDs without controller intervention, a MUX for
selecting the infrared LEDs, and a level shifter. The motherboard also includes
16 potentiometers to tune the intensity of the infrared LEDs in case a stronger
or weaker signal is needed. The motherboard has no power circuity, because the
Proximity Box is powered by a PSU taken from a computer. Just three wires from
the mother board are needed to push data to the output LED strip.

<h3>The Panels</h3>

<p><img src="thumb/panel_pcb_render.png" alt="The panel"/></p>
</a>
Figure 12. The panel
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The motherboard is connected to four panel circuits which correspond to the four
boxes. The panel circuits contain TI's TCA9535 I2C I/O expanders that read in
the pulses from the TSSP sensors. Since no hardware interrupts are available at
this scale, the I/O expanders were simply sampled very quickly to obtain the
pulse width. The panels also have four FETs that modulate the infrared LEDs.

<h3>The Subpanels</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
The subpanels were not actual circuit boards, but a schematic exists for it.
Each panel is connected to four subpanels, which corresponds to the four rows of
sensors on each box. The subpanels were constructed with plenty of hot glue and
ribbon cables.

<h2>The Backend Software</h2>

<p class="blocktext">
The gist of the code is that I had to measure the pulse width (indicating signal
strength) of every sensor through I2C, convert pulse width to pixel color, and
then send the data to the LEDs.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The challenge was doing this fast enough for the system to respond in real time.
Thinking that I was working with a large and slow system, I did a few hacks with
loop unrolling, a few I2C header-skipping shortcuts specific to the I/O
expander, and parallelized polling. It turns out I underestimated my hacks, so
the ProxBox updates so fast (I don't remember the exact rate, but it was
definitely over 100 Hz), it's almost like a shadow under your finger tips.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The code for this project is in this
<a href="https://github.com/jongtao/ProxBox/tree/demo"> GitHub repository</a>
(used with the Code Composer IDE). I have to admit, some of the code is
disgusting, since I added a lot of fixes in the last minute. The following is a
cleaned up version of my <i>main.c</i>.
