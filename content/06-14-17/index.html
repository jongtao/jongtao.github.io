<p class="blocktext">
This project is an exercise of integrated style circuit design. As of today
(2017), integrated circuits on silicon remain too expensive for tinkering, so
discrete bipolar-junction transistors on a printed circuit board were used in
this project. In addition to the choice of using discrete transistors,
monolithic design techniques and limitations, such as bandgap compensation and a
lack of coupling capacitors, were used to stay true to the spirit of integrated
circuits.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
The FGC-200 is a transistorized function generator capable of generating
high-frequency triangle, square, and sine waveforms.  The output waveform
frequency can be controlled from 0.1 Hz to 40 MHz with a capacitor and two
resistors in conjunction with an internal 1.245 V bandgap voltage reference.
Because the function generator uses a bandgap voltage reference for its internal
circuitry, its frequency and waveform characteristics are resistant to changes
in temperature and power supply. The circuit can be used with a supply voltage
as low as 5 V and consumes approximately 100 mA.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The output waveform symmetry can be varied through the ratio of the two
frequency-control resistors. Advanced frequency control, such as sawtooth
waveform generation, pulse width modulation, and frequency modulation, is
implemented by using current source equivalent circuits in place of the two
frequency-control resistors.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The triangle, square, and sine waveforms are output through three independent
output buffers. The output for all waveforms is 1 V<sub>P-P</sub>, symmetrical
around 2.0 V from ground. Each output stage is capable of sourcing or sinking up
to 200 mA through their internal 50 Ω source terminations.

<h2>Application Description</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
Current flowing from the FALL and RISE pins are used to respectively charge and
discharge the timing capacitor C<sub>t</sub> on the TIME pin. The function
generator alternately applies those currents to the capacitor to produce a
voltage triangle wave, from which the square wave and sine wave outputs are
derived.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The period of the generated waveform is equal to the time it takes for the
capacitor's voltage to rise and fall 1 V<sub>P-P</sub>. In this way, the
currents on the FALL and RISE pins (I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>) control the
waveform's rising and falling time, which define the waveform's period. Thus,
these two currents control the frequency of the waveform. This relationship is
elaborated in the later section "Description of Frequency from a Schmitt Trigger
Oscillator." With <i>f</i> as the output frequency, let <i>C</i> be the timing
capacitor's value and <i>V</i> be the V<sub>P-P</sub> of the generated waveform.
</p>
<div class="equation_img">

If the programming currents I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> are equal,
</p>
<div class="equation_img">
<img class="equation" src="latex/freq2.png" alt="symmetric frequency equation"/>
</div>
<p class="blocktext">
A caveat of applying the timing capacitor is that it produces unintended
oscillation. Parasitic inductance of the conductor from the capacitor to the
function generator combined with the self resonance of the capacitor contribute
to this oscillation. A simple remedy is to place a damping resistor in series
with the timing capacitor to supress the oscillation.
</p>

<h3>Resistive Programming</h3>

<a href="img/resistive.png">
<p><img src="thumb/resistive.png" alt="Resistive programming programming"/></p>
</a>
Resistive programming
</div>
<p class="blocktext">
The waveform can be programmed by placing resistors on the FALL and RISE pins to
ground (VEE). The current flowing through the resistors is determined by the
bandgap referenced voltage at the pins and the values of the resistances. In
general, current I = V<sub>REF</sub> / R, where V<sub>REF</sub> = 1.245 V and R
is the programming resistor.

AC-coupled control
</div>
<p class="blocktext">
The circuit to resistively program the function generator can be modified to
provide electronic waveform control with the addition of capacitors. The low
impedance FALL and RISE pins can receive a small signal current as an input with
this modification. With the small signal current input <i>i</i>, let
<i>v<sub>i</sub></i> be the small signal input voltage and <i>r<sub>i</sub></i>
be the controlling input resistor. Meanwhile, the capital letters of <i>I</i>,
<i>V<sub>REF</sub></i>, and <i>R</i> represent the static bias conditions.

Direct coupled control

<p class="blocktext">
The resistive programming can be replaced with transistors to provide direct
control to carry out relatively slow frequency functions such as frequency
sweeping or duty cycle adjustment. The transistors can be placed on the FALL and
RISE pins in common-emitter configuration with degeneration. This circuit is a
transconductance amplifier whose current outputs are fed to the input pins.
Operational amplifiers can be added to improve the linearity of the control.

<h2>Story Time: Beginnings of the Function Generator</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
I wanted to make a function generator because it seemed like a good project that
would take me back to the basics. The project allowed me to focus on the methods
it took to design one rather than the final result.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
There are simple ways to build a simple function generator, such as with opamps,
555 IC timers, or monolithic function generator ICs (essentially building a
function generator with a function generator). However, I wanted a performant
solution that I could actually design and build myself. As a result, I aspired
to build a function generator that would be comparable to the reknown MAX038 IC
or the HP3112A function generator, the type I had used in my university labs.
Not only that, I wanted build it entirely with transistors as if it was an
integrated circuit.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
This project's topology was inspired by a final exam from a communication
electronics class at university. The particular exam problem that inspired this
project was one that explored waveform control with a schmitt trigger oscillator
where a timing capacitor was charged with arbitrary currents. This method allows
both fine waveform shape control with frequency control in a single circuit. The
circuit was something I felt I needed to see for real.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
The requirements I set forth to achieve was a function generator that could
generate triangle, square, and sine waves. The circuit should also reach at
least 20 MHz and have waveform shape control, namely for rising and falling edge
rate (this also provides duty cycle and frequency modulation capabilites). I
also wanted the frequency to be somewhat immune to temperature and power supply
changes. Finally, the circuit was to operate on 5 V so that I could easily use
the circuit with other circuits and have moderate power consumption.
</p>

<h2>Detailed Circuit Description</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
The core of this function generator is an RC oscillator. The oscillator is built
on a fast schmitt trigger and a bandgap voltage reference that produces stable
biasing and control. The oscillator produces both triangle and square waveforms.
The function generator uses an over driven differential pair for shaping the
triangle waveform into an approximated sine waveform. The output stages are
class AB push-pull buffers.

</div>

<h3>Schmitt Trigger Oscillator</h3>

<p class="blocktext">
The function generator uses a Schmitt trigger oscillator, which operates by
alternating between two voltage thresholds and charging a timing capacitor
accordingly. When the schmitt trigger sees that the capacitor's voltage has
reached the low threshold, the schmitt trigger begins charging the capacitor and
starts looking for when the voltage reaches the high threshold. The trigger
discharges the capacitor when the capacitor's voltage reaches the high
threshold, and then the cycle repeats. This charging-discharging action produces
a triangle wave across the timing capacitor.
</p>

<h4>Description of Frequency from a Schmitt Trigger Oscillator</h4>
<p class="blocktext">
The generatred waveform's shape and frequency are defined by the timing
capacitor and the currents used to charge and discharge the capacitor.
</p>
<div class="img">

<img src="xfig/time_plot.png" alt="Plot of triangle wave"/>
</a>
<p>Plot of triangle wave</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The definition of a capacitor can describe the time it takes for a capacitor to
charge a certain amount of voltage (ΔV = V<sub>H</sub> - V<sub>L</sub>), given a
constant charging current.
</p>

<div class="equation_img">
<img class="equation" src="latex/capacitor.png" alt="Capacitor timing equation"/>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The period of the triangle waveform is the time it takes for the voltage on the
capacitor to rise (t<sub>1</sub>) and fall (t<sub>2</sub>). The capacitor is
charged by a current I<sub>1</sub> and discharged by a current I<sub>2</sub>. We
can substitute the times with the description derived from the definition of
capacitance. Note that the times and voltages in the following equations are
assumed to be differences.
</p>

<div class="equation_img">
<img class="equation" src="latex/period.png" alt="Period equation"/>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
From the period, we obtain frequency.
</p>

<div class="equation_img">
<img class="equation" src="latex/frequency.png" alt="Frequency equation"/>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
If the charging and discharging currents are the same (I = I<sub>1</sub> =
I<sub>2</sub>), the resulting triangle waveform on the capacitor is symmetric.
In this case, the frequency equation can be simplified further.
</p>

<div class="equation_img">
<img class="equation" src="latex/symmetric.png" alt="Symetric waveform equation"/>
</div>

<h4>Implementation of the Schmitt Trigger</h4>
<p class="blocktext">
The advantage of this type of oscillator is the low number of external
components needed while retaining controllability of waveform shape and
frequency. With this topology, no inductor is needed as with resonant circuit
oscillators. Also, controllability implies stable frequencies and amplitude,
provided that the source of control is stable as well. In the case of this
project, a bandgap voltage reference provides that stable control.

<p class="blocktext">
The Schmitt trigger of this function generator is a single ended trigger built
on a transistor pair. It is inspired by the prior art schmitt triggers in the
figures of
<a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US4219744">US Patent US4219744 A</a>[1].
My trigger design began its life as the exact circuit in Figure 1B of the
patent. I replaced the resistors in the design with active transistors to
improve designability and control, although it introduced non-idealities from
transistor biasing and temperature.  There are more advanced topologies, but I
wanted something simple enough to build and something that operated with low
voltages.

<h3>Combatting Temperature Changes</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
In my Schmitt trigger, the high and low thresholds are set by reference
currents, the single resistor R20, and multiple level shifts diode in the
feedback loop. The low-input threshold is determined by the voltage across the
reference resistor R20 created by the current source on the schmitt_low net of
the feedback loop plus the voltage drops from the level shift diodes. When the
trigger is triggered at the low threshold, the resistor sees an increase in
current equal to the differential pair's tail current, which shifts the
trigger's threshold to the high-input threshold. The hysteresis sets the output
waveform's amplitude and frequency.  Tight control of this hysteresis is
critical to obtaining stable results with the function generator.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
Stable current sources are needed to produce a stable hysteresis that the
critical to the performance for the function generator. In this project, the
reference currents are provided through a bandgap referenced bias network to
resist changes in temperature and power supply. Unfortunately, the level shift
diodes have a forward voltages that change with temperature. This disturbance
was not compensated in this project, since they only affect the offset of the
generated waveform from ground, a less important aspect of the waveform. As long
as the schmitt trigger's hysteresis is stabilized, the generated waveform's
frequency and amplitude would also be stabilized.
</p> 
<h3>Output Stage</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
The output stage of the Schmitt trigger is designed with fast switching speed in
mind. The stage is a TTL-style output stage with an active load in the form of a
Wilson current mirror. The output driver in the bottom portion of this stage
uses a voltage clamping diode (diode connected transistor) to prevent the
driving transistor from becoming fully saturated.  This feature improves
switching speed by avoiding saturation to prevent charge storage in the
base of the driving transistor. This technique is commonly known as a Baker
clamp or found in the form of a Schottky transistor.
</p> 
<p class="blocktext">
The top half of the output stage is an active load to complement the bottom
driving portion. This Wilson mirror load replaces the simple resistive load
found in typical TTL circuits. The active load presents a very high output
impedance, which improves switching speed in addition to the saturation clamp.
</p> 
<p class="blocktext">
Despite fast speeds from the topology of the output stage, the design is not
without detriments. The output stage is asymmetric in that it can sink up to 200
mA (limit of the transistor) while only being capable of sourcing about 20 mA
(limited by design around power consumption).  This asymmetry causes the rising
and falling edge times to be different depending on the current to be sourced or
sunk. This asymmetric switching behavior is exacerbated with increased
frequency, because the output stage needs to source or sink more current to
generate higher frequencies.
</p> 
<h3>Bias Compensation</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
The bias compensation circuit compensates for the trigger's bias current. The
BJT that forms the input of the trigger injects its base bias current into the
timing capacitor. The extra current from the base causes asymmetry in the
waveform where the rising edge is faster than the falling edge. In addition to
asymmetry, the extra current reduces the tuning range of the function generator
at the low frequencies.  In the case where the inteded charge and discharge
currents are zero, the capacitor's voltage would slowly climb due to the extra
base current. Eliminating the extra current would lower the minimum possible
frequency.
</p> 

<div class="img">

<img src="thumb/fgc200_compensation.png" alt="FGC-200 Bias Compensation"/>
</a>
<p>FGC-200 Bias Compensation</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
In the function generator, the extra base current is not reduced but redirected
away from the capacitor by the bias compensation circuit. The circuit sinks the
base current so that the current does not contribute to the timing capacitor's
voltage. Since the current depends on transistor characteristics that vary with
manufacturing, the current to be sunk needs to be tuned after the function
generator is assembled.
</p> 

<h3>Current Switch</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
The current switch is a simple diode switch bridge that can be constructed with
only four diodes. A similar diode switch can be found in classic function
generators such as the HP3312A. This current switch is used in conjunction with
sourcing and sinking current sources to charge and discharge the timing
capacitor.
</p>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/fgc200_switch.png">
<img src="thumb/fgc200_switch.png" alt="FGC-200 Current Switch"/>
</a>
<p>FGC-200 Current Switch</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
From a perspective using current, the current switch relies on the control
signal to provide the current to satiate either of the programmed current
sources so that only one of the programmed current sources sink from or source
to the output. When the control signal is sourcing current, current can only
flow to the bottom current source. Because of the high impedance of the lower
current source, the voltages naturally work out to shut off the top-left and
bottom-right portions of the bridge. As a result, current only flows in the
top-right and bottom-left portions. When the control signal sinks instead of
sources current, these portions of the diode bridge swap roles and current flows
in the top-left and bottom-right portions.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
From a perspective using voltage, the control signal changes the biasing of the
diodes to provide alternate paths for current to flow. The controlling input
voltage is referenced to the voltage of the capacitor. To source current into
the capacitor, the input voltage must be at least V<sub>F</sub> (diode's forward
active voltage) higher than the capacitors voltage. To sink current from the
capacitor, the input voltage must be at least V<sub>F</sub> lower than the
capacitor's voltage.
</p>

<h3>Frequency Control Current</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
Two transconductance amplifier provide the frequency control current to charge
and discharge the timing capacitor. These amplifiers are aways on, and the
current switch determines which amplifier's current is used for the timing
capacitor.  The amplifiers are identical apart from the current mirror on the
rising edge control amplifier to flip the current direction from sinking to
sourcing.
</p>

<div class="img">

</a>
<p>FGC-200 Transconductance Amplifiers</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
From a high level point of view, the amplifiers are op-amps that buffer the
internal reference voltage through a transistor in common-base configuration.
The common-base transistor buffers the user's input current to the timing
capacitor. This configuration provides a good frequency response, suitable for
modulating input with both small and large signals.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The transconductance amplifiers accept either a resistance or current as its
input. The amplifiers act as current buffers with a low impedance input. The
input also outputs the same voltage as the bandgap referenced voltage, which can
be used with an external resistance to create a current that is independent of
power supply changes. That derived current from the extermal resistance is
intrinsically buffered by the amplifier. In this way, the current controls can
accept either a user's resistances or high impedance current sources.
</p>

<h3>Bandgap Voltage Reference Generator</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
Bandgap voltage references are circuits that use the inherent temperature
sensitivity of semiconductors to compensate for temperature changes in other
semiconductors. Through this technique, the output voltage of the reference
becomes based on the semiconductor's bandgap voltage, a fundamental constant of
nature.  Non-idealities cause some deviation from this voltage in actual
implementation, but the resulting voltage from implementation is still somewhat
stable with temperature.
</p>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/fgc200_bandgap.png">
<img src="thumb/fgc200_bandgap.png" alt="FGC-200 Bandgap Voltage Generator"/>
</a>
<p>FGC-200 Bandgap Voltage Generator</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
In this function generator, the bandgap voltage reference topology is a textbook
design. The reference generator uses two reference components with different
current-voltage relationships and similar thermal sensitivity. A transistorized
op-amp examines the difference between the two components and produces a
reference voltage. The reference voltage is solely derived from the difference
in the components' current-voltage relationships, independent of temperature.  A
temperature coupling caveat is discussed in the PCB design section.
</p>

<!-- Insert picture of reference generator from textbook p320 -->
<div class="img">
<a href="img/textbook_bandgap.png">
<img src="thumb/textbook_bandgap.png" alt="Textbook Bandgap Voltage Generator"/>
</a>
<p>Textbook Bandgap Voltage Generator [2]</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The textbook's description of the voltage reference mentions a starting
condition problem. The two reference components remain off if they are off,
because this state satisfies the same requirements that causes the op-amp to
produce the reference voltage.  The textbook does not provide a solution for
this, because it is the responsibility of the op-amp, not the reference
components, to handle this edge case. My solution was to shift the op-amp's
output voltage with transistor Q14 so that the op-amp's output saturates against
the ground rail earlier to prevent it from manipulating the reference components
too early.
</p>

<h3>Bias Network</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
The function generator relies on the bias network, which is stabilized by the
bandgap voltage reference. The bias network consists of a bootstrap circuit, a
bias current generator, and a bias distribution section.
</p>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/fgc200_bootstrap.png">
<img src="thumb/fgc200_bootstrap.png" alt="FGC-200 Bootstrap with bandgap generator"/>
</a>
<p>FGC-200 Bootstrap with bandgap generator</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The bootstrap circuit provides an initial imprecise current to start up the
bandgap voltage reference generator and the tail currents to run other
transistorized op-amps. Although the generated current is imprecise, it can
still be used to bias differential circuits without too much trouble. The
current it generates is proportional to the base-emitter voltage V<sub>BE</sub>,
which decreases about 2 mV/K, independent of power supply variations.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The bias current generator provides the main reference current from which all
other bandgap-referenced currents are derived. The generator is a
transconductance amplifier that applies the bandgap reference voltage over a
current-programming resistor to produce the main current. This current is then
used via a current mirror to produce the different currents used throughout the
circuit
</p>

<div class="img" style="max-width: 50%">

</a>
<p>FGC-200 Bias Generator</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The bias distribution is a giant current mirror that derives different current
"taps" from the main reference current. The current mirror uses emitter
degeneration to derive the currents. For large emitter degeneration resistors,
the derived currents only depend on the ratio of resistors and the main
reference current. The bias distribution mirror also uses a beta helper
transistor and a decoupling capacitor inside to decrease coupling between the
different taps. The beta helper adds some gain error, which is tolerable since I
was looking to only gaining independence from temperature.

</div>

<h3>Sine Shaping</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
The sine shaping circuit distorts the triangle wave from the function generator
into a tanh, a sine wave approximation. It uses the triangle wave to over drive
the shaper's differential pair, causing non-linear distortion near the peaks of
the waveform. The circuit "snips" the sharp peaks from the triangle wave,
leaving an approximated sine wave.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
This sine shaper is difficult to design due the design relying on the
non-idealities of the transistors in the differential pair. For the most part,
this shaper circuit is designed experimentally. There exists more controlled
circuits, such as the typical piece-wise sine-shaping technique that uses more
than 10 or more shaping diodes to accurately shape the waveform. I chose to use
the simplicity of the differential pair sine shaper over the piecewise topology,
since I had to build this circuit by hand.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The shaper circuit is not only difficult to design but also highly susceptable
to inaccuracies in its input, inacGcuracies in its biasing, and temperature. As a
result, this sine shaper is just a novelty circuit that produces merely an
approximation of a sine wave.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The amount of distortion, set by the tail bias current, must be tuned the
amplitude of the triangle wave input. In typical operation of the function
generator, the triangle wave's amplitude changes slightly with frequency, so the
distortion varies slightly with frequency.
</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="blocktext">
Mismatch between the sine shaper's offset reference and the input waveform's
offset causes the sine shaper to distort the triangle wave asymmetrically. A
problem with this constraint is that the triangle wave's offset changes with
temperature, by the design of the Schmitt trigger. To solve this problem, I
intentionally "pre-distort" the shaper's offset reference with temperature
sensitive diodes so that it matches the temperature change produced by the
Schmitt trigger. The Schmitt trigger's waveform offset changes with the voltage
of the two active diodes in its feedback loop, so I created a circuit to provide
a voltage reference that depends on the voltage of two active diodes. In this
way, I compensated for temperature sensitivity of the shaper's symmetry.
</p>

<h3>Output Stages</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
The function generator has dedicated output buffers for each of the three
waveforms. The amplifiers are class AB emitter push-pull circuits. Although the
circuits are technically class AB, they have been biased more towards class A to
minimize crossover distortion and to improve frequency response.
</p>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/fgc200_output.png">
<img src="thumb/fgc200_output.png" alt="FGC-200 Output Stage"/>
</a>
<p>FGC-200 Output Stage</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The buffers for the sine and square wave are special in that they reuse the
voltage offset diode inside inside the circuits they are buffering. Normally,
two diode voltage drops are needed to convert a class B push-pull amplifier to a
class AB amplifier. The two diodes also need a common-collector prebuffer to
drive them, which changes the output waveform's offset to an inconvenient level.
By reusing a diode voltage drop from the buffered circuits, I lower the
transistor count and avoid additional complexity.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The buffer for the triangle wave was constructed in the more typical way, since
there was no existing diode voltage drop for it to use. This buffer also has
additional circuitry to perform a level shift so that its output waveform offset
matches that of the other buffers.
</p>


<h2>Design Methodology</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
Although the focus of the FGC-200 project is electronic hardware, much of the
work was done in software in the form of automated design and simulation. On a
design involving 86 transistors, iterating the design by hand would trigger
flashbacks to my days of late-night university homework cram sessions. In
addition to automation, a key to designing a large system is to design and test
in small parts before integrating them together. The human brain can only do and
remember so much.
</p>

<h3>Automated Design with Python</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
Having every part of the system affect every other part of the system is an
inevitable feature of analog design. As a result of this predicament, I divided
up the function generator into subsystems and implemented mathematical design
models for each subsystem in Python programming.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The design models mapped given desired output characteristics of a subsystem to
the internal configuration of the subsystem.  Internal configuration includes
attributes like biasing, component values, or subtle topology changes. The
models themselves also verified that the given inputs produced valid designs, so
I didn't need worry about design mistakes myself.
</p>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/python_model.png">
<img src="thumb/python_model.png" alt="Python design model of the Schmitt trigger"/>
</a>
<p>Python design model of the Schmitt trigger linked with the bias subsystem
model</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The models for the subsystems could be instantiated separately with given
inputs, a capability that allows me to chain together or duplicate subsystem
models to produce a larger model for full system automated design. In addition
to producing a large design model, the instantiation allowed me to easily create
different designs for comparison.
</p>

<h3>Circuit Simulation with SPICE</h3>
<p class="blocktext">
Following the automated design, I implemented SPICE circuit models of each
subsystem with the parameters found using the automated design program. Like the
automated design program, the function generator circuit model was divided into
many subsystems that could be operated independently.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
Each subsystem model also had an ideal test circuit that represented the
environment the subsystem would be used in. This test circuit is known as a
"test bench" in the hardware world or a "unit test" in the software world. The
ideal test circuits allowed me to gain confidence in and iterate on the design
of a subsystem without worrying about the rest of the system. As a result of
this method, I abstracted alway the details of subsystem internals and obtained
design confidence at the subsystem level. I could reliably integrate the whole
system together to perform full simulations of the entire function generator.

<p class="blocktext">
The simulated results from SPICE are compared with the results from the Python
design model to ensure that the models match. Note that even with simulation
there are non-idealities with the electronic components that cause the results
to be slightly different from that of the ideal design model.

<h2>Printed Circuit Board Design</h2>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/pcb.png">
<img src="thumb/pcb.png" alt="FGC-200 PCB Layout"/>
</a>
<p>FGC-200 PCB Layout</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The printed circuit board (PCB) was designed using a 2-layer 0.8 mm thick FR4
board. All components were placed on the front side, along with most of the
traces. In this way, the back side was preserved as an unbroken ground plane to
complement the traces on the top, a technique that lowers trace inductance at
high frequencies. Because there was no room for the power rail near the center
of the board, it had to be placed in a ring around the circuit, bridging
toward the center of the circuit from the back side.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
Although the circuit was supposed to reflect the integrated design style, the
physical dimensions and materials used are quite different from a silicon wafer.
The large scale of this circuit meant that trace inductance is significant.
Decoupling capacitors were a requirement, going against what is capable or
necessary within an integrated circuit.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
Another difference with the PCB is its thermal resistivity compared to silicon.
Differential circuits and temperature compensation circuits, like the bandgap
reference, require tight coupling of the components because they compare the
behavior between components.  A temperature difference between components would
add an unwanted difference to those comparisons. In textbooks, these circuits
are described with the assumption that the silicon substrate would thermally
couple the components together.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
In the light of this thermal limitation, I placed related transistor pairs close
together and far away from sources of heat to prevent the pairs' temperature
from drifting apart. I could cause various circuit characteristics to drift by
placing a warm finger on one of the transistors in a pair.  Interestingly, the
characteristics don't drift if I place a warm finger on both transistors of a
pair, which demonstrates the impact of temperature differences. Ultimately, care
with thermal coupling resulted in improved frequency stability.
</p>

<h2>Detriments</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
The function generator has detriments in its waveform shape and in its
practicality in application. These detriments are inherent to the topology.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The triangle wave amplitude changes with frequency, since the Schmitt trigger is
not able to switch the timing currents quickly enough. As the frequency
increases toward the limit of the trigger's response speed limit, the waveform's
amplitude overshoots the trigger's threshold for the time it takes the trigger
to respond. This behavior also makes frequency programming of the function
generator inaccurate.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The sine wave shape distorts severely with the triangle wave's amplitude and
frequency. Much of the distortion comes from the changing amplitude of the
trinagle wave as previously described. Also, the sine shaper's frequency
response is also limited, which causes its amplitude to greatly drop after
around 30 MHz.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
In a practical application, the timing capacitor is placed off of the main
board. This introduces a series inductance with the timing capacitor and creates
an unintended resonant circuit. Oscillation in this resonant circuit starts when
the function generator switches the charging currents. The high impedance of the
current sources used to charge the timing capacitor allows the voltage
oscillation on the timing capacitor to ring with little damping.  A solution to
the oscillation problem is to place a small damping resistor, about 10 Ω, in
series with the timing capacitor.
</p>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/parasitic_oscillation.JPG">
<img src="thumb/parasitic_oscillation.JPG" alt="Parasitic oscillation from timing capacitor"/>
</a>
<p>Parasitic oscillation from timing capacitor without damping resistor</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
This series resistance improvement can eliminate the oscillation, but it
introduces a voltage offset due to charging current flowing through this
resistance. The voltage offset can be severe enough to reduce the tuning range
of the function generator, because high frequencies ranges need higher charging
currents.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The ultimate solution to the oscillation would be to eliminate the parasitic
inductance of the conductor going from the function generator's current switch
to the capacitor. Soldering the timing capacitor directly to the function
generator can reduce much of the oscillation, but it is not practical to a user.
On top of that, oscillation may still occur due to the capacitor's
self-resonance. Perhaps this is a big reason why RC-based oscillators are no
longer a popular solution for test instruments that need to produce pristine
waveforms.
</p>


<h2>Cost to Prototype and Manufacture</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
The cost for prototyping materials was US $81.77, which includes the cost of
components from multiple units with extras, PCB fabrication, taxes, shipping,
and other fabrication goodies like solder paste stencils. Thanks to the rigorous
design process, only one payment of this prototyping cost was needed to make a
working circuit.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
At the 10 unit scale, the raw cost of the components alone amounts to US $7.72,
while the PCB cost is about $2. It's safe to say that the FGC-200 is a $10
function generator.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The labor cost of assembly is extremely high. Although I have a reflow oven and
stencil to save time on soldering, I don't have a machine to place the 157 parts
onto the board for soldering. The board takes about two hours to assemble. At
a hypothetical wage of about US $10 per hour, the FGC-200 costs $20 to assemble.
The inclusion of labor cost brings the cost of the unit to about $30.
