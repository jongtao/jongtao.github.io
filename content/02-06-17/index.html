<h1>A Simple LED Logic Probe</h1>

<p class="blocktext">
Here is a simple LED logic probe I made in dark times when there was no
multimeter to be found. It has back-to-back light emitting diodes for
bidirectional current indication and one current limiting resistor.  The logic
probe is compatible with 3.3 V and 5 V logic levels.

The drawback of the bidirectional feature is that the probe is usually
referenced with ground or the power rail, so the "direction" is really just an
indicator of the reference voltage used. In actual use, only one of the LEDs
light up.

<p class="blocktext">
I built the probe to debug 7400 series logic student projects on breadboards.
The probe is only really useful when you can control the clock to examine the
system tick by tick.
