<p class="blocktext">
I made this AM (<a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation">Amplitude Modulation</a>)
radio transmitter for a communication electronics class. I originally built this
on a breadboard, but I decided to make it more permanent. There were other
projects in the class where having a transmitter was helpful for debugging. This
radio was built incrementally over a couple of months, so the final "design" is
a bit of a cobble.
</p>

<h2>The Radio</h2>

<p class="blocktext">
The following video is a demo of the transmitter. It shows a practical example
of amplitude modulation in both the frequency and time domain. It also shows the
<a href="http://www.tpub.com/neets/book21/90a.htm">trapezoidal Lissajous</a>
for analyzing AM linearity and modulation index.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
In the video, I broadcast from the radio and receive the signal with an SDR
(Software Defined Radio).  The spectrum display is from SDR-Sharp via an SDR
receiver, and the audio in the video is from the demodulation by SDR-Sharp.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The cool thing about seeing the spectrum is that you can clearly see the audio
spectrum shifted up by the carrier frequency and also mirrored. Higher pitched
notes appear farther away from the carrier, while lower pitched notes appear
closer to the carrier. This shift and symmetry agrees with the mathematics of
<a href="http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/mixers/rf-mixers-mixing-basics-tutorial.php">frequency mixing</a>.

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p class="blocktext">
This radio works by controlling how strongly a class C amplifier drives a
<a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/serres.html">tank circuit</a>
(L3, C12, C14). Essentially, the tank circuit is an electrical energy tank
filled with energy in the form of charge bouncing back and forth within the
circuit, like a child swinging back and forth on a swing. By controlling how
strongly we drive the tank circuit, we can control the amplitude of the
oscillation, just as how we can control how far a child on a swing goes by
pushing the child harder or softer.
</p>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/swing.png">
<p><img src="img/swing.png" alt="Swing Analogy"/></p>
</a>
Using a child as an AM transmitter is not recommended.
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The radio is designed to transmit in the commercial AM broadcast band from about
500 kHz to 1700 kHz, so its broadcast can be received with any common AM
receiver. Regulations from the FCC
(<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7d7340be2c94a5f3ced35900dd72b14e&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt47.1.15&amp;rgn=div5">Part 15</a>)
limit the antenna length and power. The radio's broadcast range is poor, across
a small room at most.

<h3>Setting the Carrier Frequency to Transmit</h3>

<p class="blocktext">
The carrier frequency is set by the resonant frequency of the tank circuit (L3,
C12, C14). The frequency generated by the oscillator must match the resonant
frequency for the strongest transmission. It may be difficult to match the
frequency with an oscillator if the Q value (selectivity) of the tank is high.
I chose to use a tunable 555 circuit as an oscillator. A CMOS version of the 555
was used to reliably reach frequencies around 1 MHz.
</p>

<h3>Amplitude Modulation</h3>

<p class="blocktext">
The audio section consists of a 741 op-amp with its output buffered by
transistor Q1. The audio output signal from this section sets the "DC" voltage
(DC relative to the carrier frequency) at the collector of the driving
transistor Q3, which implements the class C amplifier. This DC voltage sets the
amplitude of oscillation via Q3.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
Transistor Q3 is driven to saturation by the oscillator through Q2.  The
tank circuit smooths out this sharp driving action. Since the tank holds
energy and continues the oscillation back at the collector of Q3, the change
in voltage at Q3's collector is the difference between the target amplitude
set by the audio and the amplitude of the tank circuit's oscillation.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
The tank circuit's amplitude diminishes over time due to resistive losses
and loss through broadcasting, so Q3's operation can be thought of as
topping off the tank at each cycle until the amplitude of oscillation is
equal to the audio's amplitude. In this way, the audio signal controls the
amplitude of the oscillation and creates amplitude modulation.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
There are caveats of using a tank circuit in this way. Transistor Q3 may not
drive the tank strongly enough to follow a large amplitude increase in the
audio signal. A second caveat is that the tank circuit must allow its
oscillation decay quickly to follow a large amplitude decrease in the audio
signal. This limitation is apparent in an image, later in this post, of a
Lissajous pattern where the audio signal is a square wave.
</p>

<h2>Notable Features</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
The 7805 regulator provides a DC bias to an audio input to power electret
microphones, which make things more fun.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The audio section mixes (additive mix) a stereo audio input to a mono
signal.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
Inductor L4 provides a rough match to the antenna's capacitance at the
resonant frequency. A 1 mH inductor seems to do the trick for a 3 m random
wire antenna.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
The 555's frequency is highly susceptible to supply voltage. Also, its
frequency drifts with temperature as its timing resistors heat up. It's a
"feature." 
</p>

<h2>Comparing Theory to Real Life</h2>

Let's measure!

<p class="blocktext">
The following image from a textbook shows the voltage that would be observed at
the collector of Q3.The sharp spikes in voltage occur when the radio drives the
tank circuit so that the oscillation has an amplitude equal to the audio signal.
As shown, the amplitude of the oscillation follows <i>g(t)</i>, the audio
signal. The textbook measures the voltage against a different reference so the
plot is upside down compared to what would I would measure in the following
pictures.

<p class="blocktext">
The following image shows the actual voltage at Q3 compared to the oscillator's
output. It's not as ideal as what the textbook describes, but it's close enough.

<p class="blocktext">
The next image shows the output to the antenna, right after the tank circuit.
The tank circuit acts as a filter and removes the sharp edges from the driving
of the tank. The result is a clean sine wave.

<h3>Lissajous Analysis</h3>

<p class="blocktext">
Lissajous patterns are cool.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
The X signal is the audio signal, while the Y signal is the modulated
output. The
<a href="http://www.tpub.com/neets/book21/90a.htm">trapezoidal Lissajous pattern</a>
can be used to measure linearity and modulation index of the signal. The figure
of merit in linearity is how straight the sides of the trapezoid are.
</p>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/small_lissajous.JPG">
<p><img src="thumbs/small_lissajous.JPG" alt="Lissajous with small audio
signal"/></p>
</a>
<p class="blocktext">
Audio Input: Small amplitude 1 kHz triangle wave
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
X: Audio 2 V/div, Y: Modulated 2 V/div
</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
The asymmetry in the trapezoid of the following image reveals leftover
distortion from the driving of the tank circuit. The linearity between the audio
input and the resulting envelop is ok.
</p>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/large_lissajous.JPG">
<p><img src="thumbs/large_lissajous.JPG" alt="Lissajous with large audio
signal"/></p>
</a>
<p class="blocktext">
Audio Input: Large amplitude 1 kHz triangle wave
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
X: Audio 2 V/div, Y: Modulated 2 V/div
</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
As the
<a href="http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf-technology-design/am-amplitude-modulation/modulation-index-depth.php">modulation index</a>
increases, the trapezoid will become taller. At an index of 100% the trapezoid
becomes a triangle.
</p>

<p class="blocktext">
The following image shows what happens when I overload the audio amplifier with
a very large signal, making the op-amp very unhappy. The radio is not capable of
reaching 100% modulation.
</p>

<div class="img">
<a href="img/overload_lissajous.JPG">
<p><img src="thumbs/overload_lissajous.JPG" alt="Lissajous with overloaded

<p class="blocktext">
Audio Input: Extremely large amplitude 1 kHz triangle wave
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
X: Audio 2 V/div, Y: Modulated 2 V/div
</p>
</div>

<p class="blocktext">
Next, I replace the audio signal with a square wave of reasonable amplitude.
The X-Y plot reveals two trapezoids, which correspond to the rising and falling
edges of the square wave. The sides of the trapezoids form an ellipse, a classic
Lissajous shape for phase shifts.
