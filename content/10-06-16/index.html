<h1>SC-70 on the Breadboard (Again)</h1>

<p class="blocktext">
The <a href="../12-28-15">last time</a> I breadboarded an IC with an SC-70
package, I didn't have any prototyping boards with me, so I resorted to paper. I
regard that as a bad move, because the paper is flexible. Flexing motion
eventually rips the wires off of the package.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
This time, I got mini prototyping boards to hold everything together. The board
makes the connections to the package more reliable, especially for repeated
insertions on a breadboard.

Before soldering, the prototyping board was covered with Kapton (Polyimide) tape
to prevent the package's pins from touching the plated holes. Then, a drop of
thick flux was placed on the taped area to stick the IC onto the tape. The flux
holds the IC still to make soldering the first wire onto the IC easier. Note
that after soldering, the IC is mainly held in place by the wires soldered to it
and not by the flux.

The wires are 32 AWG magnet wire with easily burnable insulation. These wires
connect the IC to breadboard-compatible header pins mounted on edge of board.
Since the forces of insertion act on only the header pins and board, the wires
and IC are undisturbed. The header pins are mounted horizontally on the edge so
the prototyping board won't take up unnecessary breadboard space.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
After soldering is complete, another layer of Kapton tape is added to hold the
IC and its wires down.
