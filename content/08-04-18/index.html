This is a fast line scan camera implemented with an AMS TSL3301CL sensor IC.
The camera can be used to make high speed swept 2D images, as in factory line
inspection, or as a geometry acquisition device, as in line following robots or
range finders.

The line scan camera assembly is an AMS TSL3301CL mounted on a PCB with an
S-mount lens. The assembly costed $31 USD in parts and PCB. For prototyping
control, I used an STM32F103RB and a SN74HC161N counter.

The TSL3301CL is a 300-dpi linear optical sensor array with integrated 8- bit
analog-to-digital converters. The optical array consists of 102 pixels and is
8.573 mm wide. The sensor has a 1 MHz pixel rate, which means that the sensor is
capable roughly up to 9.8 kfps (1 MHz / 102 pixels).  Interestingly, a variant
of this, the TSL1401CL, exists without the integrated high speed ADC. It seems
that this cheaper variant is capable of a higher frame rate of 63 kfps (8 MHz /
128 pixels), but it would depend on the quality of integration of an external
ADC.

The PCB contains nothing more than the IC itself, decoupling capacitors, and a
connector. This simplicity is fine if the camera is right next to the driving
device, but it might have signal integrity problems if it was mounted far away
from the driving device with long wires.  Perhaps, I would include differential
drivers and receivers in a robust implementation. Soldering the IC to the PCB
was difficult because the IC would drift on molten solder and become misaligned,
even with my reflow oven. I had to manually align it afterward with hot air and
a few careful nudges. The PCB is 18 mm by 36 mm in size.

The lens assembly is a standard S-mount lens, also known as an M12 lens. These
types of lenses are quite cheap an popular, since they are widely used for
security cameras. The lens mount screws directly onto the PCB, and the lens is
easily swappable. I did not choose the lens very well and ended up wasting about
20% of the pixels through bad vignetting. Still, the lens assembly was usable
and could produce reasonable images.

For control, I used an STM32F103RB microcontroller, which is simply what I had
on hand.  According to the TSL3301CL datasheet, all I needed was a USART device
to drive it. However, the TSL3301CL required extra clocks in addition to the
ones used for communication for operation, which was messy to implement with the
USART device clock line.

<p class="blocktext">
Instead of using USART, I decided to drive the
TSL3301CL sensor with a continuous clock and to communicate with the sensor
using UART. This gave me easy communication compatible with the microcontroller
without needing to worry about clocking. The requirement was that this device
clock had to be phase-locked with the UART module clock and be the same as the
UART bit rate. As a result, I derived the device clock by taking the
microcontroller's high frequency clock output and dividing it down with a
counter IC. Due to my clocking scheme, the highest UART bit rate I could get was
4 Mbit/s. The microcontroller output 8 MHz, which I divided down to 4 MHz with
my SN74HC161N counter. Perhaps I should be using a CPLD to get the most out of
this sensor.

<h2>Software</h2>
<p class="blocktext">
The microcontroller's software was divided into two layers. The first layer
implemented the low level USART interface exactly as described in the TSL3301CL
datasheet. The second layer provided a higher level interface to applications,
which boiled down to a function that takes a picture with a certain exposure
time speed and other functions that tweak sensor settings.

In addition to the embedded software, I also wrote a quick MATLAB program that
received image data from the microcontroller and plotted the data with a
waterfall plot. The microcontroller takes pictures periodically and pushes the
data to my MATLAB program through a USB serial connection. Each row of pixels is
plotted as a row of pixels in the waterfall plot. Coincidentally, if one
physically sweeps the camera at a constant rate, one can obtain a 2D image that
is displayed on the waterfall plot.
